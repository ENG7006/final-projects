# Final Projects: A Guide for the Perplexed

I have intentionally not said very much about final projects, with the idea that not having lots of time to execute them, even minimally, will mean you can have a proper sense of their scale. Which is: far lower than what you would ordinarily expect out of a 7000-level course's final project. (To wit: I'd ordinarily expect a 25-page research paper.) Here, I'm aiming for the equivalent of a 6–8pp. paper, or a 15-minute conference presentation.

### Overview
Here are, in no particular order, what your final projects will entail:

1. A cover letter (for each individual student, even when you're working in groups) of about a page that details your evaluation of the project and its success.
2. A spec for your project. (See below: Spec Specs.)
3. The project according to spec.
4. A document detailing any modifications to spec you may have made over the course of executing your project, and rationales for these modifications. (Hint: yes, you may modify your spec.)

### Timing
Here are the timing guidelines for the project/rest of the semester:
* Week of April 11: Individual meetings with Scott about final projects
* Week of April 18:
  * Draft of final project specs are due not later than **11:59pm on Wednesday, April 20.**
  * **April 21: Class time** is dedicated to work on final projects. Attendance is optional, however.
  * **April 22:** Scott's approval/disapproval of final projects specs go out, along with commentary.
* Week of April 25:
  * **April 28: Class time** is final project "crits." These should not be formal presentations, but are instead meant to give your classmates and Scott enough of a sense of where you are in your project that we can offer you helpful feedback as you move into the final stages of your project.
* Week of May 2:
  * **May 3:** Final projects are nominally due not later than 11:59pm.
  * **May 4:** Scott can easily accept projects up to 11:59pm.
  * **May 5:** Scott spends the day working on grading. He can accept some final projects, with negotiation, up until 11:59pm.
  * **May 6:** Scott has to turn grades in. Scott cannot accept projects later than noon without substantial and significant negotiation.

### Format
The final project can take any form you wish, but I encourage students to move beyond the "traditional paper" format. By this I mean: a research paper that presents an argument in a linear fashion, meant to be read on (or aloud from) the page, whose reading is meant to its primary mode of consumption. You may take this route if you wish—especially if you have an idea that you can really only develop in this manner. *If you take this option, the paper should be a conference presentation of approximately 15 minutes.*

However, I encourage students to engage in other forms of work. To be sure, it is perfectly acceptable for "alternative" forms of work to include nothing other than written material. For example, a speculative design document with zero things implemented (because, for example, implementation is impossible) would be fully welcome.

The normative ideal for this final project, as many of you have heard Scott say in individual meetings, woudl include two things: (1) a design document (very similar to the design document that accompanied the Makey Makey project) that includes elements (even a great many elements) of speculation, and (2) a making project (p5.js coding, Makey Makey, or otherwise) that implements some *small* (and I do mean **small**) portion of the speculative design you describe in the design document. It may even only hint at things to come—even (especially?) if you have no plans or ability to actually keep working on the thing.

I am fully willing to consider any other formats for final projects you devise. The further away from the normative protocols of academic knowledge-production, the better. This is the time to flirt with the dangerous desire to make other things than research. Don't worry, you have Scott's permission. Also, you have his help in figuring out how to re-integrate these desires back into more normative forms of academic work.

### Substance
The final project should explicitly engage, in some substantially and clearly-articulated manner, some aspect of the humanistic side of the course. This can be *anything at all* from the course reading, no matter how trivial-seeming it is, no matter how much a slant rhyme you need to devise to get it to fit, no matter how much of a crazy person it makes you feel like. (Actually, feeling like a crazy person is a good idea here.) It should, however, really work through/in/on/around some matter of critical, interpretive, historical, or other "humanistic" importance to you, in a way that you can communicate to another human, given the context of our work together this semester.

That's very broad, but it is the best description I can muster for what I'm hoping you'll do, which is something that, I hope, I can't have foreseen myself.

### Specing specs
Here are the specs for your specs. They must specify, to the best of your ability and at the highest resolution possible:

* The function of any making (software, hardware, creative, other) aspects of your projects

* The outline *and substance* of any written materials (cf. the spec for the design document for the Makey Makey project). This includes:
  * The major sections of the document
  * The length of those sections (word count; these can be approximate, but they must be explicit)
  * The purpose or effect of each section of the document—that is, what each section must *do* for a reader
  
* The responsibilities of each team member, if you are working in teams
